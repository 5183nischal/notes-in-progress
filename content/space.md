title: The Dot

Walk through the [[light]] tunnel  
which is the whole extended  
history of space[[time]],  
a literal looking back into  
the distant past,  
then do it again   
when the [[heart]] is ready  
to know there is [[nothing]]  
that is [[not]] [[perfect]]  
in this pattern that presents  
as self-similar prism  
proving even paradise  
was conditional on a tree,  
a [[trace]] of what is  
beyond perfect bliss,  
this path of purest gift  
grown in the grace of a hidden [[book]],  
a hole of light letting in,  
letting on about the luminous  
unseen,  
which passes like [[peace]]  
through any understanding  
until you let go  
and simply live it,  
left happy in the [[shadow]]  
of your [[self]], now just [[here]]  
to serve the resonant [[soul]].

### Traces

* Unfolding, enfolding
