title: Floating Tales

A butterfly just butted in  
and is being quite belligerent.  
  
I must begin to write,  
though what it is I cannot say,  
opening the [[heart]] of her orange wings  
tipped white then back to black   
with each new [[line]] about how she led me,  
first [[through]] yellow flowers where she fed  
on a smell somewhere between  
carrion and butter, as if [[death]]'s delicacy  
were living right [[here]] at the dune's summit,  
and then deeper through the forest  
where we found a shy duiker  
who finally chose to show himself.  
  
I'd feared a tragic end, yet  
here he is t[[read]]ing daintily his [[truth]]  
on paths only he can tell,  
as he shares his air with the trees  
and this interloper laden with the scent  
of rotting wood and fresh earth  
and [[root]]s which reach right across  
the layers of litter lit up  
with a [[light]] so fierce I sneeze  
as I step onto the beach,  
my monarch guide gracing the single  
piece of driftwood drawing itself,  
inch by tidal inch, back to whence it came  
and now everything is glowing [[white]]  
across the glimmering waves,  
which mark their passing on these empty miles   
and I can barely bring my[[self]]   
to see such boundless overwhelm,  
so I sing remembrance and bodysurf  
clear [[blue]] and laugh my head off   
and swear never to write a word of it.  
  
But [[now]], again, this damn butterfly is [[be]]ing  
impressively persistent, pointing out  
that it's [[not]] my story, but hers:  
a tale of how she found a human   
who could hear her, and hauled him  
before the morning light so he could learn  
what a moment means and how she still  
had to come back, and get trapped,  
just so she could remind him - silly man! -  
to make his [[way]] back to [[simple]] words:   
his holy unimportant duty  
which has deepened into joy.
