Two trees guard either end  
of the path:  
massive milkwoods who greet me  
every morning on my way  
[[through]] the forest, singing  
_salaam_.  
  
The one by the bottom boundary  
grows right around the walkway  
and it's taken me a full decade  
to [fig](https://thebluebook.co.za/canto-i/bedien.html)ure out that all  
those different branches  
come from the same trunk:  
one wooden [[heart]] of the dune  
that radiates fixed carbon,  
storing sun[[light]] on both sides  
of our flimsy little fence.  
  
Tonight I got to share  
this favourite tree and then  
went walking on water.  
  
The wide horizon ringed by red;  
and the [[moon]] half full;  
and the incoming tide   
the colour of peace  
as I knelt in wet sand  
with a sand plover perfectly reflected   
where land meets sea so that  
up and down seem the same;  
and my [[soul]] sang as three  
cormorants flew over in salute;  
and I found one [[white]] feather,  
[[not]] to be picked up, just to [[be]] seen  
as pointing the way home  
[[here]], where the ands go on forever.   
  
So I came back  
to this guardian tree  
and it told me  
how gentle our path is,   
a [[secret]] forest orchid in flower,   
carved outside time  
in a trunk that [[remember]]s stillness  
and [[will]] show you  
if you simply have the courage  
to reach out and ask.
