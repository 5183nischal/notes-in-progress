title: Heaven Scent
---

What the world smells like right [[now]]  
will never [[be]] said, and my [[heart]] sings  
with this one certainty.  
  
Sunset's ring has wrapped the far horizon,   
though it's not about these signs.   
Do [[not]] stop [[here]] and make a science.   
  
Hold out your hand, palm up, and plea with  
this solitary wave  
in whose gradual [[sea]] I am.  
  
Hasten to help them dismantle the tent;  
it's time to move on and only  
those who are [[will]]ing to help  
  
get to see the unscripted moment  
where wind catches her tail  
and sweeps the [[white]] canopy high up in  
  
surrender and her final veil:  
the victory of Rohanni riders,  
roused by this wedding night,   
dawning [[light]].
