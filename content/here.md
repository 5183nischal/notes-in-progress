Hear him cry,  
o worthy reciter.  
Surely your tears have the ring  
of [[truth]].  
  
Meanwhile,  
the whales have returned  
to our wide bay to breed;  
giants of the deep undergoing  
their own [[soul]] journey,  
stopped here  
for the [[love]] of what you [[read]],  
a [[book]] revealed  
for all the worlds.  
  
Might and [[mercy]]  
on a straight path   
from the water's [[heart]],  
all in thrall before the throne.
