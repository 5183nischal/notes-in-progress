title: Simply Song

Morning and time again  
to sing as earth sinks  
into [[light]]  
and the dawn chorus.  
  
It's grey and cold,  
but today the birds   
are truly [[be]]autiful  
and the key is just to trust  
that they'll chime in  
at the right moment.  
  
The whole [[song]]  
woven together of it[[self]]:  
yes, everything is  
in worship, al[[way]]s.
