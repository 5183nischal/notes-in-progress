title: Crossing Bare
---

Well, dear friends,  
the captain's now a gardener  
who watches carefully  
the weeds of his words  
and all the little whispers,  
while the others do their work  
without interference.  
  
There's no more war [[here]],  
just the [[joy]] of asking  
the weather what [[will]] be best  
to grow next season  
as we sit for a while  
in a winter afternoon,  
wandering back to the old [[song]]  
I sang you as we swam  
our horses across the _Mzintlava_,  
in [[love]] for a [[moment]]  
and forever.
