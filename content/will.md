title: Free Will

Here is the perfect prison,  
made entirely by [[moon]][[light]]  
moving [[through]] the wooden  
bars of my balcony  
as the baritone ocean busks  
for an empty beach in the background,   
and I am brought to my knees  
by the healing birth took me for,  
knowing there is no [[way]] out  
of this moment-to-momentness.   
  
A moonlit magic carpet  
makes the [[mercy]] of no escape  
silver clear:  
no beginning, no end,   
[[now]]here to [[be]]  
but [[here]],   
where even crickets insist  
on the scented eternity   
of this evening.
