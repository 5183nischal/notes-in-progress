title: No-one Special
---

Can you be [[nothing]]  
special when the help of God comes  
and wake up in the predawn [[light]]  
with no idea of who it was  
that spoke and who it was  
that heard?  
  
Every sense of somebody   
swept a[[way]],  
every [[hope]] of attainment  
ash to be scattered  
as the search is called off.  
  
Will you then find  
shelter in the [[eye]] of the storm,  
or sit at a loser's last supper  
and trust that [[love]] al[[read]]y won:  
that this is the signed [[will]] and testament  
if you can see it for your[[self]]?
