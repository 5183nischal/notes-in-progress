title: Not That
---

It's not the endless play of [[light]]  
when you close your [[eye]]s,   
nor how every cell seems to open   
into peace.  
  
It's not bird[[song]]  
nor breaking waves.  
It's not even the quiet beat  
of your [[heart]], or the [[way]]  
you can hear the world  
[[remember]]ing you,  
if you learn to listen well.  
  
It's not the pins and needles  
when you finally get up  
and go to the toilet,  
just to [[be]] reminded  
how human you [[real]]ly are,  
nor the golden sunrise  
flooding though your window,  
[[will]]ing you to write  
what mortal really means.  
  
It's all these things  
and none of them,  
and something deeper down,  
until you find it's [[nothing]]  
but another [[simple]] morning,  
woken up in God.
