What of that ancient [[heaven]]ly dynamo  
and how you [[burn]]ed, angel-head,  
for a whole [[life]]time,  
or learnt to paint the [[truth]] of space  
for another?  
  
The best minds are always broken,  
for [[nothing]] can contain this memory.  
  
Yet still, [[mercy]];  
and somehow this fool [[remember]]s  
the three magi  
with their many mirrors for each  
moment,  
the [[real]] [[holy]] laughter hidden in  
each meaningless choice made  
meaningful by the simple magic of   
reflection.
