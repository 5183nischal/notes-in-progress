title: Butterfly Book
---

It's deep autumn [[now]],  
but the butterflies are still [[here]]:  
evergreen [[white]] and orange  
oracles of calm air,  
their wings lit up as we look again   
at the open Book,  
this [[time]] happening  
on the Throne verse  
and my [[heart]] is [[broken]] free  
into wide [[blue]] emptiness.
