I am Yours  
and You are everyone and  
everything and all  
that comes between, split up  
in the seemingly im-  
perfect [[way]] it always   
was and will [[be]], until you [[wander]] in  
and drown beneath the weight  
of that first Word, this final  
en[[light]]enment:  
  
one last silhouette  
standing still before the Face  
uttering that fragrant sentence,   
having figured out you  
were never alone,  
[[not]] even [[now]]  
at the end of everything  
and - in your laughing tear  
a crack - the coming dawn,  
our promised due.
