Three waves break, one behind the other  
in high winds and a rainbow rides  
across the [[white]] spines  
as if they were crashing though all colour  
to that first dye, cast before the worlds  
and picked up clumsily  
by an ignorant man who did not yet k[[now]]  
that this stooped position  
was his proper place, right between  
moon-moved _rahma_ and what remains  
hidden, for I could [[not]] [[be]] more certain  
were it revealed, nor would I [[remember]]  
yesterday, when the dolphins returned  
in what only seems to be  
to same [[sea]].
