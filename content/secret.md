title: Secret Garden II
---

A pair of [[white]] wings wafts by  
as you tell me to look into the [[eye]] of the Be[[love]]d,  
and the palm leaves waltz lazily in [[light]] wind  
[[will]]ing these few words meant to let go  
of everything, for there is no meaning  
but what is meant, right [[now]].  
  
Rouse your[[self]], sleeper,  
split the second it took to [[read]] this  
and slip into your [[heart]],  
the sacred House of God,  
our secret garden,  
[[here]] for all to see.
