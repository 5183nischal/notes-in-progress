[[Here]] I sit, watching  
the [[sea]], hungry and fearful  
and utterly fulfilled.  
  
I have felt brightness  
bounce [[be]]tween us  
as it [[burn]]ed up every chance  
this [[mirror]] had imagined,  
every image it had made  
in all its subtle vanities,  
leaving only a surface meant  
to [[serve]] whomever looks within.  
  
The view from here is vast:  
sheer across this [[self]]-disclosing  
[[blue]] dance tinged purple orange,   
as we on this wide earth   
are [[grace]]d again with a darkness   
which holds no doubt  
that our [[light]] goes on  
forever.
