Today blew apart  
and burnt me up,  
reading what I can bare. In [[truth]],  
[[be]]ing [[read]] by what comes before  
creation and its [[blue]] crack;  
what waits after  
and asks us only to [[remember]].  
  
Three [[simple]] letters   
to reveal the whole show  
and me, hooked on a feeling  
that seems to be on repeat  
in the background, being  
made to witness  
an unemployment form  
and rejoice this chance  
to work on only one  
more return.
