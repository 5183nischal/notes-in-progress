title: Servate Fidem
---

Life goes on forever,  
whether you ack[[now]]ledge it or not.  
  
It's love we're [[here]]  
to service: one purring [[heart]]  
stripped down to bare parts  
on a steep and narrow path  
in pursuit of the only [[real]] science:  
to call your [[self]]'s bluff.  
  
There is no separation.  
  
There is [[nothing]] in creation   
but [[love]].  
Here is the lodestone;  
the source; the [[simple]]  
[[truth]] that holds even  
the stars themselves apart  
  
until that last annihilation,  
first breath of [[life]].
