# Coastal Plain

"When your work is done, turn to devotion,  
And turn to your Lord for everything." 94:7-8

Here is my gratitude  
for being   
quenched by the quiet,  
for being  
shown how deep silence is  
yet another way to flow  
in the low winter [[light]]  
which turns our whole bay  
brighter than anyone can bear;  
[[water]] and wind and flame  
lit up whenever you walk  
the clear way up  
this wild coast, calling me  
home.
