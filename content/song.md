"Day  
And I gathered fragments of blue dense" - Joseph Cornell

---

Sometimes, there [[will]] [[be]] sorrow,  
but then you'll stand again,  
as if you were al[[way]]s standing,  
[[eye]]s cast down in humility  
before the grand [[blue]] solitude  
of [[sea]].  
  
And just to have seen it,  
to have been brought [[here]]  
in your chains and shown  
that there is no choice,  
that the stone [[self]]  
will be shaped within   
without you...  
  
Lapis lazuli and an old [[love]]  
song about Lazarus,   
all of it meant  
to make this [[life]]   
entirely remarkable.
