title: Telling Time
---

Two nights ago in a dream,    
you held my face so tenderly  
I felt everything else in the world  
fall apart except this embrace,  
lathered in the lemon warmth  
of a [[love]] made to bring me back  
to purity.  
  
Yesterday, you told me a real story  
about forbidden young fire  
and that fall at first sight  
for what we think is   
separate from us,  
our own [[soul]] seemingly held   
captive in the [[heart]] of another.   
  
It was a tale I've heard told [[time]]   
and again,   
though you tapped out is beat  
with such [[simple]] beauty  
I couldn't help but give in  
to belly laughter and the call  
of our Beloved.   
  
Today, the russet stubble has been  
rubbed clean, creation complete  
and all in utter glory.   
It's raining [[mercy]], oldest friend,   
the rivers are singing their return:  
rhythm and purpose and origin and end  
rolled up in my _Rab_, my _ruh_,   
this reverence.
