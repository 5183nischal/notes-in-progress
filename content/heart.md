title: Hacking Hearts
---

We were hacked  
and the most harrowing images  
were hauled up in the middle  
of a slide about risk and exposure.  
  
Here again is the whole [[story]]:  
the dark side of [[love]]  
allowed without being  
welcomed.  
  
Have you learnt yet  
how to keep your heart open in hell,  
how to say no without hardening,  
how to [[be]] neither helper nor helped?  
  
Just the help,  
at home in horrible beauty.
