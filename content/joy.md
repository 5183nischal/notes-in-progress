title: Joy
---

I press the pattern to my nose,  
threadbare and walked over  
by generations of my people,  
their footprints still [[here]]  
beneath the [[blue]] and red and [[white]],  
and those people that passed it to them:  
all this [[soul]]  
in the warp and woof of what  
I have come to declare  
my submission on,  
my poverty and bewilderment.  
  
A colourful carpet crucible -   
half starshine, half clay -  
with hints of a kingdom come  
in the crinkled rim, crying [[heart]],  
hands empty before the decree,  
certain and celebrating another [[death]]  
practiced well.  
  
Old words like the desert,  
still never walked over  
in this exact configuration   
poured into my [[empty]] core,    
here,    
washed clean by one grain    
swirling an endless ocean,    
_a speck of utter delight_  
as you said last [[night]]  
when we sat cross-legged  
on a shore of beating [[water]]  
and being.  
  
We have known such joy,  
have walked barefoot  
in the boundless,  
sat and played with the [[secret]]  
of it all by that gothic cathedral   
only to have a small girl  
come by and, giggling to her[[self]],  
go far deeper than we dared,  
laughing at the look of surprise  
on our faces, as if being blown apart  
were not a benediction  
but a birthright.   
  
And again, in the distance,  
like an old drum beat carrying  
its message, its simple meaning   
across valleys and rising [[time]],  
my brother's [[voice]], gentle and full:  
  
"Once you understand, just dance  
and [[be]] thankful."
