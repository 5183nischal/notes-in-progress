A oboe climbs the moving stairs  
carved by orange [[moon]][[light]]  
and the balanced scales   
of orb and mighty ocean.   
  
Quite what this music is  
is impossible to say,   
though the [[self]] that wandered with me,   
who walked up that winding case  
then wafted past the far horizon,  
knows it is the perfect [[moment]],   
and sits now, reflective,   
in that [[peace]]   
of rescued past, while I clear  
his [[empty]] plate and get on  
with the dishes, having [[signed]]  
my [[surrender]] to the flow of [[time]],   
[[trust]]ing that it will keep me  
coming back to family dinner.
