I'm so sorry I left you  
waiting all these many years,  
womb-friend, while I went off  
in search of the sun's true trajectory  
and the sum of thought and man's  
unconscious mind.  
  
When really it was [[here]]:  
[[nothing]] to do  
but choose for myself submission,  
then [[light]] a single candle  
and allow you back  
to fulfill the simple act  
of folding up your shadow,  
[[surrender]]ing to what we were  
after time.  
  
We absorbed each other,  
birth-twin, before the cut  
which breached my deliverance  
and carved you into the agent  
of beneficence;  
two tears running up   
my lowered forehead,   
facing [[truth]].   
  
I [[love]] that  
you'll tempt me again,  
for we are [[not]] separate  
and there is no end to [[mercy]].
