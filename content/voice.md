a knowledge by unknowing,  
rising beyond all science." — St John of the Cross

You are the gatheredness which becomes oneness itself. You are that one that becomes separation." — Shaykh Sa'd ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī

    since you were slaughtered and by your blood
        you bought people for God" — The Apocalypse of John of Patmos

will therefore clarify at last  
what I esteem of highest [[grace]]:  
my soul revealing it can rest  
without a place and with a place.  
  
Although I suffer a dark night  
in mortal life, I also know  
my agony is slight, for though  
I am in darkness without light,  
a clear [[heaven]]ly life I know;

however black and blind my day,  
to yield my soul, and free of strife  
to rest - living darkly with no ray." — St John of the Cross
