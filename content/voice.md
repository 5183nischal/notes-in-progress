and all the things I owned were his:  
I have no flock to tend  
nor any other trade

following sheep about the hills,  
say that I am lost, that  
wandering in love I let  
myself be lost and then was won." — St John of the Cross  

---

---

"All perfected things come home" — Rainer Maria Rilke  

---

as a seal on your arm,

"As a poet of the sublime, of the bliss of Edenic companionship, of the whirlwind blast and burn of rapture, of paralysis before impossible love, she confides her words to Aphrodite, and to us.

the stars write.

I too am written,  
and at this very moment  
someone spells me out." — Octavio Paz  

---

Though the word is both common and universal,

of holiness and peace.  
In deepest solitude  
I found the narrow [[way]]:  
a secret giving such release  
that I was stunned and stammering,  
rising beyond all science.  
  
I was so far inside,  
so dazed and far away  
my senses were released  
from feeling of my own.  
My mind had found a surer way:  
a knowledge by unknowing,  
rising beyond all science." — St John of the Cross

There is a gathering together and a dispersal contained in every breath.  
[[Nothing]] remains for more than a second - in the very moment a thing dies it is born again." — Shaykh Sa'd ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī  

---

"Who pours out like a spring knows cognizance;  
who leads him spellbound in serene creation,  
ending inside beginning, in ending begins." — Rainer Maria Rilke  

---

"Thin branches have the winged noise of chaos.  
A cold [[moon]] tumbles into random shadows.

inside this Gate of the Dao, by altars of eternity?" — Wang Wei  

---

"All things stay at reast:  
darkness and holy [[light]],

"rise singing, praising back to pur relation.  
Be here among the vanished; near the tree  
of death, be ringing glass that shatters even  
  
as it rings. Know conditions of nonbeing,  
the endless ground of your vibration down  
in you: one day you'll be wholly fulfilled." — Rainer Maria Rilke  

---

"O soothing cautery!  
O wound that is a joy!  
O gentle hand! O delicate touch

---

"The god of true mercy  
would enter differently the pure, the vast  
the gatelike open heart \[...\]

like a quietly playing child of cosmic union." — Rainer Maria Rilke  

---

"The path of the traveller is no more than two steps although it holds several dangers.  
One step is to leave the duality of the _ha_, and the second is to abandon the arena of existence.  
From this position of direct witnessing, separation and gatheredness are one, just as the number one is present in all members.  
You are the gatheredness which becomes oneness itself. You are that one that becomes separation." — Shaykh Sa'd ud-Dīn Mahmūd Shabistārī

"And he came and took it from the right hand  
of the one seated on the throne. And when he took  
the book the four animals and twenty-four elders  
fell before the lamb, each holding a harp and gold bowls  
filled with incense, which are the [[prayer]]s of saints.  
And they sang a new [[song]], saying:  
    You are worthy to take up the book scroll  
        and to open the seals upon it  
    since you were slaughtered and by your blood
        you bought people for God" — The Apocalypse of John of Patmos  

---

will therefore clarify at last  
what I esteem of highest [[grace]]:  
my soul revealing it can rest  
without a place and with a place.  
  
Although I suffer a dark night  
in mortal life, I also know  
my agony is slight, for though  
I am in darkness without light,  
a clear [[heaven]]ly life I know;  
for love gives power to my life,  
however black and blind my day,  
to yield my soul, and free of strife  
to rest - living darkly with no ray." — St John of the Cross

"When his Lord said to him: Submit! He said: I submit myself to the Lord of all the worlds." 2:131
