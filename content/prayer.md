title: Breaking Day
---

To [[be]] with the meaning  
of sunrise, simply,   
until the very source of what it is  
to hasten to this far horizon  
as it sinks into gold  
is given you by [[grace]];  
rise and fall fused  
by the feeling in your [[heart]]  
as two hadedas scream the Name  
and a starling unfolds its red-winged [[song]]  
backed by a small choir of bush shrikes,   
believing their place to be [[now]]here   
but [[here]], beholding [[heaven]]  
behind closed [[eye]]s as the clouds bleed  
crimson and a thousand other colours beside,  
breaking in waves which bring back  
a brave diver drenched by the depths,   
lying gasping on the beach, still begging  
this wide world:  
  
"Never quench me".
