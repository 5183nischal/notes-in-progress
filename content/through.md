title: Through The Singing Atoms

"His knowledge of my condition frees me from asking" - Abraham

---

This [[self]] bent over, bereft,  
finally brave [[enough]] to bare a small bit  
of [[truth]], as [[light]]ning turns the night  
some strange shade of orange.  
  
It was me who made that greeting  
as you walked back down the mountain.  
  
Only I was stone then, or  
a bit of dry brush singing _salaam_  
in the desert breeze.  
  
This body feels it, all the pieces  
it has been [[be]]fore,  
atomised again and again  
since that timeless night,  
[[now]] gathered  
to make _salat_  
and say a [[simple]] [[prayer]] of thanks  
with what was thorn and pebble,  
  
finally given one  
moment of human consciousness.
