title: Surrender
---

"The slaves of time are slaves of slaves;   
the slaves of God alone are free."

The [[moon]] has moved since I  
first arrived here:  
now the [[light]] breaks in unfettered  
by my balcony bars;  
pure and still as I breathe out  
and put me down,  
not knowing  
who will take the next breath.  
  
This silver edge of surrender  
searches out the sincere  
who have accepted separation's  
show, sure the shore  
is one more sign that here,  
even the silent depths curl  
into _sajda_ and sing  
_subhanallah_.  
  
It's all this  
[[moment]] culminating  
in a [[life]]:  
time's work  
to teach the syntax of one   
[[soul]] sought by her  
Beloved.
