title: Spectral Silk
---

Two thin strands  
of a spider's web strung  
across the window  
catch sun[[light]] streaming [[through]]  
and display a small part of its spectrum:  
tracks of [[grace]] in green and red.  
  
From [[root]] to [[heart]] a [[song]],  
set free in [[simple]] moments  
which move to thank this  
endless [[mercy]],   
at rest in its own [[remember]]-dance.
