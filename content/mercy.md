title: Mercy Me

Silver streams [[through]] the channel  
chasing the school it slid off  
in the deep afternoon [[light]],  
[[white]] [[trace]]s of cloud  
like signed slips of holy paper  
trailing salty [[line]]s in double [[blue]]  
and it just doesn't matter  
what my mind made of the majesty  
because every atom in me bowed  
and [[be]]held it, [[self]],  
waving madly.
