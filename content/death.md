title: Temple's End
---

We've been building this temple,  
quietly, the old man and me,  
placing with care each stone  
hauled here from right across  
our dispersed realm.  
  
There's been a certain rhythm,  
quietly, between old man and me,  
for all these many years,  
a kind of yearning to reach the end,  
yet here we are, beginning.  
  
Last night, in a burst,  
not born of the old man, nor me,   
all the walls (so much devoted work)   
were pulled apart, our burning centre  
doused and all we'd done destroyed.  
  
Dazed by the dark light we sat down,  
quietly, the old man and me,  
and watched smoke scent  
newly opened space.   
  
  
The he smiled,   
the old man at me, and peace  
was proffered in this pilfered holy place,  
our sacrifice perfected  
in the silence of God's play.
