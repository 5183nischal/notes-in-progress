title: Temple's End
---

We've been building this temple,  
quietly, the old man and me,  
placing with care each stone  
hauled [[here]] from right across  
our dispersed realm.  
  
There's been a certain rhythm,  
quietly, between old man and me,  
for all these many years,  
a kind of yearning to reach the end,  
yet here we are, [[be]]ginning.  
  
Last [[night]], in a burst,  
not born of the old man, nor me,   
all the walls (so much devoted work)   
were pulled apart, our [[burn]]ing centre  
doused and all we'd done destroyed.  
  
Dazed by the dark [[light]] we sat down,  
quietly, the old man and me,  
and watched smoke scent  
newly opened space.   
    
    
The he smiled,   
the old man at me, and peace  
was proffered in this pilfered [[holy]] place,  
our sacrifice perfected  
in the silence of God's play.
