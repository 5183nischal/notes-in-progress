title: Together

So many lives spent rushing  
before rolling thunder  
in an attempt to write it down,  
until this place, where I delay  
making even that first dot,  
simply because  
there is more delight in living  
than in telling truth.  
  
So I peeled an orange  
in the last patch of sun  
on the balcony  
and forgot entirely  
what I meant to say.  
  
Perhaps I was supposed to sing   
about three hundred dolphin  
and what it is to swim with them  
in crystal water and how I shared  
my love, and how they laughed  
and slapped their tails   
on the glass surface  
and filled the whole sea  
with sonic resonance  
so that I could be sure  
they already knew.  
  
Or maybe it was the story  
of Phila Ndwandwe,  
who simply would not talk,  
and how the deep blue reminds  
me of that plastic bag which watches  
over our constitution, still crying  
in the wake of her killer's testimony:  
"God . . . she was brave."  
  
They all fit together:  
the orange sun,  
the dolphin's clarity,  
blue death  
and plastic bravery,  
though I won't scratch it out  
this time.  
  
This time I'll just ask,  
_won't you come in?_  
Ma has baked fresh date muffins  
and I'm about to make some tea.
