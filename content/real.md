title: Real Dream

[[Burn]]ing day: set a[[light]]  
by how we danced last night,  
feeling you right [[here]], held  
against me while we moved  
as one.  
  
You kissed me then,  
deeply,  
while we danced and kissed  
and held the night,  
for I know [[now]],  
we can[[not]] [[be]] together.  
  
This [[self]]-exciting Reality  
wants separation,  
so I give up  
my desire for small [[love]]  
and spend this little time  
learning how to fly,  
and why [[heaven]] has boundaries,  
and how to be with trees  
or body surf [[blue]] clarity.  
  
Before two final bows  
and the end in our beginning.
