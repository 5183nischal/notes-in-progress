title: Real Dream
---

[[Burn]]ing day: set a[[light]]  
by how we danced last night,  
feeling you right here, held  
against me while we moved  
as one.  
  
You kissed me then,  
deeply,  
while we danced and kissed  
and held the night,  
for I know [[now]],  
we can[[not]] [[be]] together.  
  
This [[self]]-exciting Reality  
wants separation,  
so I give up  
my desire for small [[love]]  
and spend this little time  
learning how to fly,  
and why heaven has boundaries,  
and how to be with trees  
or body surf [[blue]] clarity.  
  
Before two final bows  
and the end in our beginning.
