title: Magic Mind

Old wizard, what a [[joy]] it is  
to [[wander]] with you   
on this windless wild day,  
your seven sermons singing  
a [[simple]] insight into the nature  
of synchronicity:  
what stitches mind and matter  
together is nothing  
but the well-tuned [[self]],  
laughing at its stretched [[shadow]],  
surely aware and uncertain.  
  
I know you knew it,  
that you looked into  
this funny little loop  
and felt its depths,  
wondering at how Wolfgang  
proved exclusion was the only [[way]]  
to weave together atom and archetype;  
all in preparation to go  
beyond both  
to an abode of neither cause nor effect,  
two bow lengths away  
from the brightest ground of our Being.
