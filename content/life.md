Life is just  
a fancy dress up party  
and we players with  
a small part,  
[[here]] to restore a rubbish pile  
and persuade you  
that it is [[nothing]] less  
than God's grand empire  
of consciousness  
we've rebuilt,  
a rainbow against red clouds  
recording helpless laughter  
and a [[grace]] we do [[not]] k[[now]],  
finished off with a [[prayer]]  
[[be]]tween [[burn]]ing flame and  
pouring rain: all one   
cycling life.
