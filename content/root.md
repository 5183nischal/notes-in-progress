Who walked this wide expanse  
last night, opened by waxing [[light]],  
and sang a fragrant [[line]]?  
  
Or fell to their knees on the sand,  
covered in silver time,  
to feel the beating earth [[through]]  
this forehead, or later pressed it  
to that tree at the entrance  
simply to thank all the forest  
for how it smelled, how it smelt  
this [[self]] and drew forth  
what can[[not]] change from a [[heart]]  
that hears only constancy,  
turning in its timeless tempo  
to touch the [[moon]]'s message:  
  
There is only [[truth]].
