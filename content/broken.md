title: Honest Fool
---

Everything that lies around you,  
all the broken pieces,  
go gather them up.  
  
Tonight, we make a bonfire  
with but a single [[hope]]:  
to get it. To really, [[real]]ly  
get it.  
  
If we gather [[enough]] fuel,  
then the flame [[will]] only [[be]] snuffed  
by returning sun[[light]]  
and maybe, in such sincere  
failure, will we find the open  
[[secret]].
