title: Unio In Separate Ability
---

Weeks it's taken us to get [[here]],  
the last few signs of a vast _surah_  
which starts with the end  
and now asks me, directly,  
  
"What will make you realise   
what the Day of Judgement is?"  
  
and, when you think you've got it;  
this moment right [[now]],  
with the [[sea]]'s first winter rainbow  
rippling into being:  
  
"Again, what will make you realise  
what the Day of Judgement is?"   
  
As if each passing were something  
all together different,  
without meaning and there for meaning   
full, felt in the deep _huuu_   
of [[blue]] before me  
abandoned and responding  
by virtue of its emptiness:  
this [[light]] [[heart]]  
luminous, weighing nothing.
