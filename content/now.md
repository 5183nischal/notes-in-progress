title: Right Away
---

You and I, sweet [[love]],  
have lost it all, sat quietly  
by a desert fire to watch the spirits  
of our seven worlds dance  
this mighty [[night]] away,  
no longer scared of the headless king  
riding down his [[line]]  
clattering spears and screaming death,  
nor avoiding our mounting doom  
and the fool's [[hope]] we wouldn't fail,  
finally in that fiery [[heart]],  
unconcerned by the offerings of angels  
or the vacant void, just one  
perpetual vessel  
[[here]] to trumpet [[victory]]  
as the [[Voice]] rings out over  
my unmarked grave where I've grown  
used to living [[death]]:  
  
"Now [[be]] it".
