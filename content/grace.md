title: aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-mustaqīm

Tell me this, sincere seeker:  
have you found   
solidarity with every act of suffering  
since the [[be]]ginning of this world,  
and are you steadfast  
in the trust  
that it is only One  
who [[will]] stand trial?  
  
---
  
Yes.  
  
Reality is  
Be[[love]]d,  
lost in [[blue]] [[mercy]]  
and raised by prostration  
on a straight path  
from perfection to  
  
Perfection.
