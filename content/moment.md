[[Here]] is the soft [[song]]  
of those far forests you walked  
last [[night]], harmony  
heard in the deep ear  
where no hunter has ever been,  
just prey  
with the presence of mind  
to seek protection  
and ask permission   
for their flight to safety.  
  
So [[be]] a bird, beloved.  
It's [[not]] so hard, after all.  
  
Tether yourself to this [[moment]],  
to what is really happening,  
and see how your containment  
is just another kind of carrier  
to what is  
beyond happening.  
  
Hover over now's knife edge,  
your [[heart]] humming  
with the honey guide:  
hear in the soft song   
her gift of being.
