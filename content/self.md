Your [[love]] is [[light]] focused  
in my [[heart]], that first messenger  
at last arrived to take the signed [[will]]  
from this bewildered debtor  
and make certain deliverance  
by dint of one declaration,  
before the father of our [[line]] turns  
the magnifying heat to flame  
and what beats in me is [[burn]]t up  
beside the sacred house rebuilt, right  
where steadfast ants last buried a seed  
deep beneath the black keystone,   
only to [[be]] [[broken]] free  
by this prehistoric holy fire,   
returned to sing its imperfection.
