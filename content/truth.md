title: Deliverance
---

There is no obligation  
but clear deliverance, darkly lit,  
of how we danced in a scented daze,  
this knight and queen in checkered [[space]],  
amazing [[grace]] to find our [[soul]] can rest  
in place or lost outside, still [[be]]tween  
the narrow gate, open [[now]]  
that no [[self]] is found to speak  
since the messenger told his truth,   
cosmic [[silence]] our transcendent function  
of eternal mind, eternally musing  
one message.
