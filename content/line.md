I saw the whole line  
before coming [[here]] to write this,  
sitting quietly at a fire  
waiting for the [[moon]],   
when you looked into my [[eye]]s  
and all we were before  
stretched around the scattered stars  
in one great cosmic circle  
straight back to my side of the [[story]]:  
two dream figures facing  
in the one fiction that can't [[be]] faked.
