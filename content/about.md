Welcome. We [[be]]gin immediately.

[_The Blue Book_](https://thebluebook.co.za) and [_Living The Blue Book_](https://living.thebluebook.co.za) are both organised as journeys from beginning to end. They are meant to be read in a specific order defined by the sidebar and general structure of each site. 

_The Blue Book_ follows in the lineage of Carl Jung's and J. R. R. Tolkien's [Red Books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxVaxOco7kg), with a [hat-tip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=628eVJgHD6I) to [Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_and_Brown_Books). It's shaped into Cantos, mimicking Ezra Pound and his attempt to fit all of history into one poetic epic using multiple languages. It just swaps out Italian for javascript, css, and markdown. _Living_, however, moves away from history or the attempt to create a unified framework to understand the flow of time. It's not about the intellect. It's about **experience**. _Living_ considers how and what we value as human beings, what sorts of knowledge actually bring us lasting happiness, and what **surrender** means in the face of a life which does have value. Conscious experience, value, and life are all structured phenomena. Surrender is not. It is not a logical matter. It has to do with the **heart**. 

Beginning with surrender, _Dyeing_ presents no definite journey. Unpick your own path through the interconnected interior. Follow the [[thread]] [[through]] it as you [[will]]. There is no right order in which to [[read]], though there is a right [[way]]. This is best [described](https://andytudhope.africa/writing/academy/yours-sincerely/) by another:

> "[[Nothing]] could enter it but the sincere act."  
> — Muhammad al-Niffarī

From here, I cannot speak. There is no 'I' to speak of what it is to die, to travel into a gatheredness which is neither collective, nor unconscious.

As always, though, there are other [[voice]]s to help navigate the void, different [[trace]]s of the same unitive consciousness.

The format for this work is inspired by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). The book is [opensource](https://github.com/andytudhope/dyeing-the-blue-book), built with [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) and uses [Aravind Balla](https://aravindballa.com)'s [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/). None of this would be possible without an ecosystem of magicians willing to share.
