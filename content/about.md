title: About these notes
---


Hi! I am [Nisch](https://nischalmainali.xyz) and these are the notes of my constrained random walk through the space of knowledge. The motivation of making these notes public with tree-like structure is to replicate my learning *journey* instead of showing my learning *outcomes*. It's often the case that the process of gathering knowledge is more valuable than the conclusions from them. These notes are my attempt at showing that process.

I primarily think and write about biological and artificial [[learning]], and technological aspects of the [[Humanities]]. These are underscored by my current goal of expanding the repitore of my [[epistemic methods]].

You can find my favorite and frequent learning resources on the internet under [[blogs]] and [[seminars]]. Here are the [[books]] I'm **reading** and hoping to read soon.
