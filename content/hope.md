title: Flight

I freed a Cape Robin  
and felt her tiny [[heart]] pulsing,  
felt the clean fear of no [[way]] out  
and the great courage to let herself  
be held, the heroic surrender  
she gave in to, having found  
that you cannot break the glass your[[self]].   
  
You can only enter in hope  
and then lose it all and let go,  
completely at the [[mercy]]  
moulded by what made both Robin and me,   
which only takes form  
in a chain of human hands,  
my own but a part  
of what brought her to the open door  
where she soared back  
to seeming separation  
as the sun set sail into  
an orange matched only by her  
bright chest.
