title: Nightwatch
---

The night is clear and thin and full  
of spectral ghosts that hover like unspoken  
words, broken in odd places  
and twisting through the distance with  
seeming ease  
to meet their end in the [[heart]]  
of a watcher, waiting for your sentence  
to fall from star-shaped holes  
in his universe, the phrase on which  
fate itself turns, a tiny dancer who smiles  
at the thought that we could [[read]] her  
in the pin-pricked past,  
that a collection of signs could surpass  
all this:  
a cosmos at every [[moment]], and wakeful,  
even in the dark.
