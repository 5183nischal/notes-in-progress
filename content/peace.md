title: The Dawn
---

I was blinded by the [[light]]  
and I laughed my head off,  
caught by the [[perfect]] wave  
and carried in such a way   
that the [[water]] showed itself   
to be radiant for no reason,  
beyond even the bird who sings  
in that blessed olive tree  
because it's beautiful:  
  
This sun set surfing,  
right after the clarity of dawn,  
was simply the [[truth]]  
that is  
and was and will be,  
before time, after it, just [[now]]  
like the few grains of salt  
still stuck to my skin  
which bid me speak  
of this favour:  
  
it is [[not]] for the few,  
nor is it what you think.
