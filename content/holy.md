title: Silver Bliss
---

I remember playing hide-and-go-seek  
so vividly I can still touch the wall  
we were crouched behind,   
the two-tone bare-brick [[white]] plaster  
barrier is [[real]], right before me,  
and us, small and huddled together,  
just t[[here]],   
breathless in the [[hope]] of remaining  
undiscovered.  
  
I can feel the warmth of that summer day,   
and the small grove of silver birches before us  
(which never quite grew as ma hoped they would)  
their peeling bark like paper that I'd sit and pull off,  
as if writing hidden [[love]] notes to a later [[self]],  
with symbols made simply  
from the grain of wood and its defiant growth  
in this strange soil it came to feel at home in,  
soil that smelled before afternoon thunderstorms  
like the original meaning of the world,  
some old and hidden memory that rises up,  
unbidden, when another piece of the past  
bursts like thunder through the glass  
that now protects us.  
  
And isn't it strange, I thought,  
sitting cross-legged on the floor next to you,  
how we still talk about trees,   
how we wind ourselves back into earth shrines  
and roadtrips to a breathing forest  
at the [[heart]] of things, where you played  
some small and beautiful note  
that stopped [[time]] and took you back  
into a hall of [[soul]]s, [[way]] back until  
you could see the window that is every [[life]]  
and all the [[light]] and darkness pouring in,  
only to dissolve in the distance between  
what you are and who you experience.  
  
Can you see that childhood afternoon   
if you look around the dream    
and dance with nothing as if it were still  
the only thing that matters?     
Can you hear the rustle  
in those paper trees, like an old [[book]]  
passed down the generations, the birches  
just messenger posts for all the worlds within,  
writ across the memory of two kids  
hiding in a grove of silver, blissfully unaware  
that there should even [[be]] such a thing  
as a holy word.
