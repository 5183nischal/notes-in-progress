Today talked of victory  
for the new Nasruddin  
as a [[song]] reached fever pitch  
spreading [[light]] from the speakers,   
like it did last [[night]] when this candle  
enflamed a crying [[heart]], carried it  
right through to morning,   
swimming now   
in winter sun so stark  
it stripped the [[beach]] of anyone,   
literally, the whole thing  
completely empty, just  
the fractal regularity of   
curling rhyme which waves  
  
me back  
like those treasure maps you drew  
as a child, unconscious that your act  
was ultimate compassion,  
just so we could [[remember]] today  
that maps don't guide others  
so much as persuade them  
that the journey is worth making;  
that there really is a chest at the end;  
that, really, it is the same  
as the one which travelled with you,   
beating all this [[time]],   
here to help you taste the [[truth]] of [[death]]  
and drag you back to endless [[life]]  
lived in between.
