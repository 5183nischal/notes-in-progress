"The importance of the moment is most important in the moment." - Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri

It's still [[here]],  
a glossy [[sea]] like glass  
which has gathered cloud  
into crowns on both sides  
of our [[blue]] horizon  
as if it were all folded  
down the middle,  
the mirror image caught  
by calm [[water]]  
as I sit and listen  
to you talk about time  
and how to transcend it  
by being held fast  
to the tale of the Prophet,  
peace be upon him,  
who [[read]] his [[heart]]  
and herded this [[story]]  
between bridge and barrier  
and broke my mind  
by simply showing  
how the greatest of all  
are forever in _sajda_,  
singing Your glory.
