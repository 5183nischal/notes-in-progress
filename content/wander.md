Everything has its way,  
a great, unmissable [[way]]  
and we walkers  
of the wilderness within  
without which we won't survive,  
[[here]] to do the work  
and trust we'll find Your track  
as we wander, lost,  
[[through]] the gift of an ebony grove  
growing beyond what we could want.  
  
Wait well, wayfarer:  
this wonder is for a wary few,  
wide awake to the way it all  
[[will]]s us to listen.
