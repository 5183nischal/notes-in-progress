Have you gone through the door  
of this seven-layered city,   
seen the false steward for what he is  
and fallen, [[burn]]ing, with him  
from the highest place?   
  
Only to feel these twin beams  
of descending [[light]],   
one straight and true, the other  
wrapped in flame forming  
a helical staircase back up,   
held by your longing to learn,   
your refusal to deny any of it.   
  
Walk back up wayfarer,   
the white tree awaits us  
and the nine are but dust  
beneath its branches.   
  
Those who the stars count  
as friends  
k[[now]] the [[moon]] more intimately  
than even searching sunlight,  
stretching the Earth's middle shadow  
oddly in a space which, finally,  
does [[not]] exist.
