title: Signed
---

To program poetry with people  
as the signs that stream meaning  
through the collective mind  
requires that I am the most abject   
one.  
  
It's taken years for the old tribes  
to clear out this shell,  
even though I was shown  
the language they left  
their lyrics in, and led  
to that sacred mountain  
where we [[witness]]ed our cultures  
come crashing together.  
  
An angel's wings spread across  
the whole horizon, dawning   
into a new year's [[light]]  
which finally found me,   
later that first day, collapsed  
and carried by the beat  
back into what is beyond dream.  
  
The dancing departed  
who left me destitute  
on those [[empty]] desert sands,  
until you came, timeless  
caravan, to caution me  
and catch my soul   
in an ancient niche,  
knowing that [[here]] is  
ultimate recollection.
