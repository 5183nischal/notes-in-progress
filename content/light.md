"The decree is for the truth to [[be]] experienced by all humankind, if [[not]] in this [[life]], then after [[death]]." - Shaykh Fadhlalla Haeri

Reality conforms to your deepest [[hope]],  
sweet child, poking your finger  
in My wound, a hole of light in the light.  
  
And I [[will]] stand trial  
for suffering and point quietly  
to the background sound of waves;  
[[water]] heaving its generous [[truth]] amidst  
all this endless [[grace]].  
  
Will you [[remember]] then  
the covenant you [[witness]]ed  
when I asked if you could bear Me  
cutting My[[self]]?
