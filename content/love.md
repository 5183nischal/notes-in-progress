title: Cleaving Love
---

The vast depths are inked indigo  
after [[read]]ing [Al-Infitar](https://quran.com/82),  
the [[line]] between [[sea]] and sky  
incandescent in the soft [[light]]  
of this ineffable intimacy  
in and of and for it[[self]],  
heard by a few itinerant walkers  
wary of the inner [[way]]s, weaving  
our intention, true  
to the [[heart]]'s permission, plunged   
into the fragrant bliss  
of boundless limits.
