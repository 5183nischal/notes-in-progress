title: Return of the Queen
---

No-one ever made it to the top  
to see the worlds entirely,  
except for you, old soul, who saw  
the joke of non-existence  
and didn't delay when you discovered  
that sensual crack in time and its  
terrifying punch[[line]]:  
there's no-one to even laugh with you  
as you feel this one dissolve  
and rain [[mercy]] on all the make [[be]]lieve  
below, because it was the most  
majestically beautiful move  
after having been both  
quarks and quasars;  
the turning quintessence  
with which you created  
this whole [[book]];  
the none in one  
from which it all burst;  
a baffled king, his head blown off,  
singing his clear [[way]] back down   
Your sheer, Your stunning Face.
